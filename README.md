# FakeWordle
My first C++ code, designed for a university project.
Compiled with GNU g++ 11.1.0 on a Linux server

Uses a word bank text file, reads in the words as strings, then proj1.cpp runs a game loop. 
The program is a simple text-based version of Wordle and was not unit tested so it breaks
very easily to incorrect data type inputs. Though it is messy, it was a good project to
start my learning in C++.  Before this, I had only written code in Python.  I could go back
and refactor this code, separate a lot of the functions and make a few classes to organize
it better, but I like the idea of leaving my very first piece of C++ code here to go back 
to and both cringe at my newbiness and gain some comfort comparing this to what I can create
now.
